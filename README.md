# TCP
Send Message from Client to Server in TCP/IP
First we need to compile the server in the Linux terminal.For that we should write this code in the Linux Terminal.
-> gcc server.c -o server
Than we need to compile the client in the Linux Termianl. For that we should write this code in another Linux Terminal.
-> gcc client.c -o client
After compiling our codes in the terminal, we need to run the client and server in their own terminals.
-> ./server
-> ./client
